spark
=====

This is the source code for Furore's public domain FHIR server called Spark.

The source code contains everything you need to run Spark, and is up-to-date with the version of Spark
running at http://spark.furore.com/fhir. 

Spark implements a major part of the FHIR specification and has been used and tested during the past 
HL7 WGM Connectathons. We, as Furore, will keep enhancing this server to support the latest versions
and add functionality, but welcome anyone who wants to support this effort and help us make Spark a 
better reference platform and playground for FHIR.
